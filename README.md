# HELLO WORLD (THE REACT WAY):partly_sunny:

This _very basic_ tutorial introduces the _very basics_ of *REACT* in a very **PG 13** manner.
Follow the instructions in [HOWTOREACT.MD](HOWTOREACT.md) & follow the code in [index.js](src/index.js)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
_disclaimer_ most of the content is from https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html :heart:.
